ATOMIC DESIGN 
Is a methodology for creating design systems, introduced by Brad Frost. It breaks down user interfaces into smaller, reusable components, making it easier to manage and maintain complex designs. The methodology is inspired by chemistry, where atoms combine to form molecules, which in turn form organisms, and so on.

Key Concepts:
Atoms: The basic building blocks of matter. In web design, these are the fundamental HTML elements like buttons, inputs, and labels.
Molecules: Groups of atoms bonded together. For example, a form label, input, and button combined to create a search form.
Organisms: Groups of molecules joined together to form a distinct section of an interface, like a header or a footer.
Templates: Groups of organisms combined to form page layouts. They provide the structure for content.
Pages: Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real content.

ANALOGY
Think of it like building a house:

Atoms are the individual bricks, windows, and doors.
Molecules are sections like walls or rooms made from those bricks and windows.
Organisms are larger structures like the entire houseâ€™s exterior or interior layout.
Templates are the blueprints of the house, showing where everything goes.
Pages are the finished house, complete with furniture and decorations.

EXAMPLE 

Atom: A button element.
            const Button = styled.button`
            background: blue;
            color: white;
            padding: 10px;
            `;

Molecule: A search form combining a label, input, and button.
            const SearchForm = () => (
            <form>
                <label htmlFor="search">Search:</label>
                <input id="search" type="text" />
                <Button>Go</Button>
            </form>
            );

Organism: A header that includes the search form.
            const Header = () => (
            <header>
                <h1>My Website</h1>
                <SearchForm />
            </header>
            );

Template: A basic page layout with a header and main content area.
            const PageTemplate = ({ children }) => (
            <div>
                <Header/>
                <main>{children}</main>
            </div>
            );

Page: A specific page using the template with actual content.
            const HomePage = () => (
            <PageTemplate>
                <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
            </PageTemplate>
            );
